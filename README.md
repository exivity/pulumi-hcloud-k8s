# Pulumi Hetzner Kubernetes (Talos)

Deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters on Hetzner Cloud using Talos Linux, powered by Golang Pulumi. This project provides reusable infrastructure code to provision, configure, and manage **experimental-grade** Kubernetes clusters on Hetzner.

## Features

- **Automated Cluster Provisioning:** Use Pulumi (in Go) to declaratively manage Hetzner resources and Talos-based Kubernetes clusters.
- **Customizable Node Pools:** Define control plane and worker node pools with flexible sizing and configuration.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** All cluster resources, networking, and firewall rules are managed in code.
- **Go Package Distribution:** This project is distributed as a Go library that can be updated via `go mod` commands, with automated dependency management through tools like Dependabot or Renovate Bot.
- **Makefile Automation:** Common tasks (build, lint, test, deploy) are automated via `make`.
- **Talos Image Creation:** Uses [hcloud-upload-image](https://github.com/apricote/hcloud-upload-image) to create and upload Talos images to Hetzner Cloud.

## 🔋 Batteries Included

This **experimental** project comes with pre-configured Kubernetes components that integrate with Hetzner Cloud. While functional, these components are designed for testing and development environments:

### **Cluster Management & Autoscaling**

- **🚀 Cluster Autoscaler:** Automatically scales worker nodes based on pod resource demands, with configurable min/max limits and utilization thresholds
- **📊 Kubernetes Metrics Server:** Provides container resource metrics for Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) and other autoscaling pipelines
- **🔐 Kubelet Serving Certificate Approver:** Automatically approves kubelet serving certificates for secure metrics collection

### **Hetzner Cloud Integration**

- **☁️ Hetzner Cloud Controller Manager (CCM):** Native integration for Hetzner load balancers, volumes, and networking
- **💾 Hetzner CSI Driver:** Persistent volume support with encryption, configurable storage classes, and automatic volume provisioning
- **🔥 Firewall Management:** Automated firewall rules for cluster communication and optional public API access

### **Storage Solutions**

- **📦 Longhorn Distributed Storage (Optional):** Cloud-native distributed block storage with replication, snapshots, and backup capabilities when enabled in configuration

### **Security & Networking**

- **🔒 etcd Encryption at Rest:** Optional Kubernetes secrets encryption using secretbox encryption
- **🌐 Private Networking:** VPC with custom subnets, private IPs, and secure inter-node communication
- **🔧 Custom Registry Support:** Configure private container registries with authentication and TLS

### **High Availability & Reliability**

- **⚖️ Multi-Region Control Plane:** Deploy control plane nodes across multiple Hetzner regions for maximum availability
- **🔄 Control Plane Placement Groups:** Anti-affinity rules ensure control plane nodes are distributed across different physical hosts (worker nodes do not use placement groups)
- **🎯 Control Plane Load Balancer:** Highly available Kubernetes API server with automatic failover
- **📋 Node Taints & Labels:** Flexible workload scheduling with custom node labeling and tainting

### **Multi-Architecture Support**

- **🏗️ ARM64 & AMD64:** Full support for both x86_64 and ARM64 architectures with automatic image selection
- **🖼️ Talos Image Factory:** Automatic building and uploading of architecture-specific Talos images

All Helm chart components are configured with sensible defaults but remain fully customizable through Helm values and configuration overrides.

## Quickstart

This guide helps you get started with a new Hetzner Talos Kubernetes cluster using the Cookiecutter template.

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Pulumi CLI](www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/download-install/)
- [talosctl](https://www.talos.dev/v1.10/talos-guides/install/talosctl/)
- [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README.html#installation)
  
Optional:

- [k9s](https://k9scli.io/) (Kubernetes CLI UI)

### Installation Instructions

#### macOS (using Homebrew)

```sh
# Install all required tools
brew install cookiecutter
brew install go
brew install pulumi/tap/pulumi
brew install siderolabs/tap/talosctl

# Verify installations
go version
pulumi version
talosctl version --client
```

#### Linux

For Linux users, please refer to the official installation guides:

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Pulumi CLI](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/install/)
- [talosctl](https://www.talos.dev/v1.10/talos-guides/install/talosctl/)

### Create a New Project

> **💡 Recommendation:** Use a dedicated Hetzner Cloud project for each cluster deployment to ensure proper resource isolation.

```sh
# Navigate to your desired parent directory (e.g., ~/projects or ~/dev)
cd ~/projects

# Generate the new project using cookiecutter
# This will execute a configuration wizard where you can customize your cluster setup
cookiecutter https://github.com/exivity/pulumi-hcloud-k8s
```

The cookiecutter command will launch an interactive wizard that guides you through configuring your cluster. You'll be prompted to set options like project name, Kubernetes version, node pool configuration, and enabled components. For a complete list of all available options and their descriptions, see the [Cookiecutter Template Options](docs/cookiecutter-options.md) documentation.

### Deploy

Navigate into the newly created project directory:

```sh
cd <your-project-slug>
```

Execute the initial deployment to create the Kubernetes cluster and node pools:

```sh
pulumi up --yes
```

**Note:** The deployment consists of two phases:

1. **Infrastructure Phase:** Creates Hetzner Cloud resources, Talos cluster, and node pools
2. **Kubernetes Phase:** Installs applications and Helm charts on the cluster

The first deployment will fail during the Kubernetes phase because the cluster needs time to fully boot and become ready. This is expected behavior since there's no built-in check to wait for cluster readiness.

After the first deployment completes (with failures), wait a few minutes for the cluster to fully initialize, then run the deployment again to install the Kubernetes applications:

```sh
pulumi up --yes
```

### Access Your Cluster

Export kubeconfig and talosconfig:

```sh
make kubeconfig
make talosconfig
```

Access the cluster using `k9s`:

```sh
make k9s
```

See [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) for all available options.
